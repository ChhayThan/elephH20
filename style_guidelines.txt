Style Guidelines of ElephH2O
----------------------------



Overall look and aesthetic of ElephH20
-------------------------

The central theme will be nature as our product heavily focused on plants and the environment. Through the webpage, we hope to convery a sense of calmness and serenity that nature is well-known for. 
We achieve this by using a soothing color palette consisting of different types of blue and green, simple and smooth illustrations, as well as a sleek font such as raleways   

Colors
-------

The colors intend to remind water and nature, therefore they will be shades of blue and green. White is going to be the color choice for the button and along with certain text sections to add more variety to the color scheme while also keeping the nature theme

These are the color codes for our palette:
- #008A65
- #4ABF87
- #87CEED
- #FFFFFF
 
Fonts
-----

The main font that will be use is Raleway from Google Fonts. Raleway is the ideal font that holds the elegance while also being highly legible for the user


Links
-----
Links will not be underlined, unbolded, and given the color green. The links will also allow the user to view different pages within our webpage and allow the ability to return to previous pages. The links will also be given an animation effect to give a sense of a living webpage. This animation may cause it to float or dissipate slightly


Buttons
-------
Button text will be green, unbolded, and lowercased. We also do not want more padding than text to make the button more appealing
Button padding will be filled with white and will have a border radius to give it a smooth appearance
Button animation will make the text dissipate slightly and upon click will go downwards as to simulate an actual button click




Tables
------
Tables may be used on our webpage if we plan to implement a leaderboard into our webpage
If so, the table will have a white background and the text will be green.
The table will have columns for usernames, plant name, and happines streak, along with a rank


Icons
-----
Icons are going to be used in our footer to represent our social media links. 
These icons will have a white circle background and the icons will be blue
